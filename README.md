Flipkart Mobiles Web Scraping and Data Visualization:
This project demonstrates how to scrape product information (names and prices) from the Flipkart mobiles page using Python's requests and BeautifulSoup libraries. It also includes data visualization using matplotlib to display the top 10 mobile phones based on their prices.

Project Overview:
Web Scraping: The requests library is used to send an HTTP GET request to the Flipkart mobiles page. The HTML content of the page is then parsed using BeautifulSoup to extract product information.

Data Extraction: The project extracts the product names and prices from the HTML content using appropriate CSS selectors.

Data Visualization: The matplotlib library is employed to create a horizontal bar chart that displays the top 10 mobile phones based on their prices.

How to Use:
Clone the repository to your local machine.

Install the required libraries using the following command:

Copy code:
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 matplotlib
Run the flipkart_scraping.py script using your Python interpreter:

Copy code:
python flipkart_scraping.py
This will scrape the Flipkart mobiles page and generate a data visualization of the top 10 mobile phones.

Files Included:
flipkart_scraping.py: The main Python script for web scraping and data visualization.
